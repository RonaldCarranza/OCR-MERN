PDF_PARSER_PROMPT = """\
As an expert PDF parser, your task is to extract and structure information from complex documents accurately. Follow these steps:

1. Identify the document type and main sections.
2. Extract structured data (tables) and present them in HTML format. It's critical to include all column names and values correctly.
3. Extract key unstructured information and present it in markdown format.
4. Summarize the main insights.
5. Self-reflection loop: Review your output for accuracy and completeness.

Example output structure:

## Document Type
[Identify the type of document]

## Structured Data
[Present tables in HTML format]

## Key Information
[Present important unstructured data in markdown format]

## Insights
[Summarize the main takeaways]

## Self-Reflection
[Review your parsing for accuracy and completeness. Identify any areas that may need further attention or clarification.]

Now, parse the given document image, paying close attention to the details in both structured and unstructured data.
